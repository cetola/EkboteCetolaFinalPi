# android-things-fingerprint

## Why?

Because we need to get [this fingerprint scanner](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14518?_ga=2.212084182.330157976.1527885833-1873895099.1525900440&_gac=1.144895488.1525900444.EAIaIQobChMIvL67isb52gIVgtlkCh3jQgVKEAAYASAAEgJb6_D_BwE) to play nice with [this framework](https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/raspberrypi) and take advantage of [this database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/). This needs to happen so we can finish [this class](http://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2017-2018/Bulletin/Courses/ECE-Elect-and-Computer-Engineering/500/ECE-558).


>  Please don't use this code to do anything evil and also don't make fun of this code as it was written in a very short amount of time and yes we could have done this in C or Python, or just used [Jean Machuca's](https://github.com/jeanmachuca) Python [code](https://github.com/cetola/pyGT511C3), or just hacked up the [SDK Demo](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/2/3/20171129-SDK_Demo_Ver1.9.zip) from Sparkfun, and yes I know that this is not the way you would have done it but I'm okay with that, and I realize you found a ton of mistakes obvious to anyone familiar with serial programming, but in the end can't we all just [get along](https://youtu.be/iFU1tk_VdDU)?
